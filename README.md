# claude-settings

My personal Claude [Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)/[Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) setup with battle-tested commands and MCP servers that I use daily.

## MCP Servers

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) configuration lives in [`.mcp.json`](./.mcp.json). These are some solid MCP server repos worth checking out:

- [Slack MCP Server](https://github.com/ubie-oss/slack-mcp-server) - 10+ Slack commands
- [GitHub MCP Server](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) - 50+ GitHub commands
- [Context7](https://github.com/upstash/context7) - Up-to-date documentation context for 20K+ libraries
- [Azure MCP](https://github.com/Azure/azure-mcp) - 40+ Azure commands

## Commands

Custom Claude Code commands that make life easier, stored in [`.claude/commands/`](./.claude/commands/):

- [`commit.md`](./.claude/commands/commit.md) - Automated commit creation with conventional commit messages
